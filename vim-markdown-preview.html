<p>Check out <a href="https://rajasegar.github.io/this-vs-that/">the deployed app</a>!</p>

<p>This uses <a href="https://prismjs.com/">Prism</a> code hightlighting with the <a href="https://prismjs.com/plugins/file-highlight/">file highlight</a> plugin.</p>

<p>Inspired by <a href="http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/">YouMightNotNeedJQuery</a>.</p>

<h2>Running locally</h2>

<p>This is a vanilla JavaScript application. You must serve the files locally in order for the JavaScript and CSS to load in the browser. For example:</p>

<p><code>
npm install http-server -g
http-server .
</code></p>

<p>Visit http://localhost:8080 to see the results.
If you make changes, restart the server.
You might have to clear the cache to see your changes. (In Chrome, open the dev tools, then right click on the browser's main refresh arrow and choose Empty Cache and Hard Reload, or configure your dev tools to not keep a cache in the first place.)</p>
